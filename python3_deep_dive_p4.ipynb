    "What is an object\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object is any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior (methods).\n",
    "* An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "* Characteristics of an object:\n",
    "  * Identity: each object has a unique name or identity.\n",
    "  * State: objects can have attributes or value that are initialized (often using constructors).\n",
    "  * Behavior: objects perform specific actions or tasks through functions (methods).\n",
    "* `object` is the ultimate base class of any new-style class in Python.\n",
    "  * `class object`\n",
    "    * Return a new featureless object. `object` is a base for all classes.\n",
    "    * It has methods that are common to all instances of Python classes.\n",
    "    * This function does not accept any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a class\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together, i.e. a template for creating user-defined objects.\n",
    "* Classes are themselves objects that are created from the `type` [metaclass](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#metaclasses).\n",
    "* Creating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.\n",
    "* Each class instance can have *attributes* attached to it for maintaining its state.\n",
    "* Class instances can also have *methods* (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",
    "* Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "  * the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes\n",
    "  * a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes\n",
    "  * a method can call the method of a base class with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`type`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `class type(object)`, `class type(name, bases, dict, **kwds)`\n",
    "  * With one argument, return the type of an object. The return value is a `type` object and generally the same object as returned by `object.__class__`.\n",
    "    * The `isinstance()` built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an object, because it takes subclasses into account.\n",
    "  * With three arguments, return a new `type` object. This is essentially a dynamic form of the `class` statement.\n",
    "    * The `name` string is the class name and becomes the `__name__` attribute.\n",
    "    * The `bases` tuple contains the base classes and becomes the `__bases__` attribute; if empty, `object`, the ultimate base of all classes, is added.\n",
    "    * The `dict` dictionary contains attribute and method definitions for the class body; it may be copied or wrapped before becoming the `__dict__` attribute."

    "  * `name` need *not* be a Python identifier.\n",
    "  * For example, `getattr(x, 'foobar')` is equivalent to `x.foobar`. If the named attribute does not exist, `default` is returned if provided, otherwise `AttributeError` is raised.\n",
    "* Note Since private name mangling happens at compilation time, one must manually mangle a private attribute's (attributes with two leading underscores) name in order to retrieve it with `getattr()`.\n",
    "  * Private name mangling\n",
    "    * When an identifier that textually occurs in a class definition begins with *two or more* underscore characters and does *not* end in *two or more* underscores, it is considered a private name of that class.\n",
    "    * Private names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for them. The transformation inserts the class name, with leading underscores removed and a single underscore inserted, in front of the name.\n",
    "    * For example, the identifier `__spam` occurring in a class named `Ham` will be transformed to `_Ham__spam`.\n",
    "    * This transformation is independent of the syntactical context in which the identifier is used.\n",
    "    * If the transformed name is extremely long (longer than 255 characters), implementation defined truncation may happen.\n",

    "  * This is the counterpart of `getattr()`.\n",

    "  * `name` need not be a Python identifier unless the object chooses to enforce that, for example in a custom `__getattribute__()` or via `__slots__`. An attribute whose name is not an identifier will not be accessible using the dot notation, but is accessible through `getattr()`.\n",
    "  * The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it.\n",
    "  * For example, `setattr(x, 'foobar', 123)` is equivalent to `x.foobar = 123`.\n",
    "  * Note Since private name mangling happens at compilation time, one must manually mangle a private attribute's name in order to set it with `setattr()`.\n",

    "  * `name` need not be a Python identifier.\n",

    "### Class body scope\n",
    "\n",
    "* The scopes of functions defined in the body of a class are not nested in the class body scope.\n",
    "* Instead, the functions are nested in the class's containing scope.\n",
    "* So when Python looks for a symbol in a function in a class, it will not use the class body scope.\n",
    "* Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#resolution-of-names\n",
    "* Rationale behind the limitation:\n",
    "  * When you define a class, it's essentially syntactic sugar for constructing a dictionary of attributes. This dictionary is then used by the metaclass (usually `type`) to create the actual class object.\n",
    "  * For example, the following class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```Python\n",
    "    class A:\n",
    "        i = 1\n",
    "        def f(self):\n",
    "            print(i)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    is roughly equivalent to\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```Python\n",
    "    def f(self):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "    attributes = {\"f\": f, \"i\": 1}\n",
    "    A = type(\"A\", (object,), attributes)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this context, there is no outer scope from which the name `i` can be accessed directly. The temporary scope for executing statements within the class block doesn't provide access to class-level attributes.\n",
    "  * Python treats objects as containers for attributes. There's not really any concept of \"variables\" other than local variables in functions.\n",
    "  * Methods within a class are implemented using function scope.\n",
    "  * This includes comprehensions and generator expressions, which are also implemented using function scope.\n",
    "  * Consequently, class variables are not visible from methods unless explicitly accessed via the class name."

    "Basic Information\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to design and implement a class that will be used to represent bank accounts with the following functionality and characteristics:\n",
    "  * accounts are uniquely identified by an **account number** (assume it will just be passed in the initializer)\n",
    "  * account holders have a **first** and **last** name\n",
    "  * accounts have an associated **preferred time zone offset** (e.g. -7 for MST)\n",
    "  * **balances** need to be zero or higher, and should not be directly settable.\n",
    "  * but, **deposits** and **withdrawals** can be made (given sufficient funds)\n",
    "    * if a withdrawal is attempted that would result in negative funds, the transaction should be declined.\n",
    "  * a **monthly interest rate** exists and is applicable to all accounts **uniformly**. There should be a method that can be called to calculate the interest on the current balance using the current interest rate, and **add it** to the balance.\n",
    "  * each deposit and withdrawal must generate a **confirmation number** composed of:\n",
    "    * the transaction type: `'D'` for deposit, and `'W'` for withdrawal, `'I'` for interest deposit, and `'X'` for declined (in which case the balance remains unaffected)\n",
    "    * the account number\n",
    "    * the time the transaction was made, using UTC\n",
    "    * an incrementing number (that increments across all accounts and transactions)\n",
    "    * for simplicity assume that the transaction id starts at zero (or whatever number you choose) whenever the program starts\n",
    "    * the confirmation number should be returned from any of the transaction methods (deposit, withdraw, etc)\n",
    "  * create a **method** that, given a confirmation number, returns:\n",
    "    * the account number, transaction code (D, W, etc), datetime (UTC format), date time (in the timezone specified in the argument, but more human readable), the transaction id\n",
    "    * make it so it is a nicely structured object (so can use dotted notation to access these three attributes)\n",
    "  * You should also remember to test your code (using Python's `unittest` package).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may have an account with:\n",
    "  * account number `140568`\n",
    "  * preferred time zone offset of -7 (MST) \n",
    "  * an existing balance of `100.00`\n",
    "* Suppose the last transaction ID in the system was `123`, and a deposit is made for `50.00` on `2019-03-15T14:59:00` (UTC) on that account (or `2019-03-15T07:59:00` in account's preferred time zone offset)\n",
    "  * The new balance should reflect `150.00` and the confirmation number returned should look something like this: ```D-140568-20190315145900-124```\n",
    "* We also want a method that given the confirmation number returns an object with attributes:\n",
    "  * `result.account_number` --> `140568`\n",
    "  * `result.transaction_code` --> `'D'`\n",
    "  * `result.transaction_id` --> `124`\n",
    "  * `result.time` --> `2019-03-15 07:59:00 (MST)`\n",
    "  * `result.time_utc` --> `2019-03-15T14:59:00`\n",
    "* Furthermore, if current interest rate is `0.5%`, and the account's balance is `1000.00`, then the result of calling the `deposit_interest` method, should result in a new transaction and a new balance of `1005.00`. Calling this method should also return a confirmation number.\n",
    "* For simplicity, just use floats, but be aware that for these types of situations you'll probably want to use `Decimal` objects instead of floats."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "* It refers to the ability to define a generic type of behavior that will potentially behave differently when applied to different types.\n",
    "* Essentially, polymorphism creates a structure that can adapt to various forms of objects.\n",
    "* Python is polymorphic in nature.\n",
    "  * duck typing: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is a duck\n",
    "  * operators are polymorphic\n",
    "* In Python, polymorphism manifests in several ways:\n",
    "  * function polymorphism\n",
    "  * class polymorphism\n",
    "  * inheritance class polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Special methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Special methods, also known as \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods, are instance methods reserved by Python.\n",
    "* Special methods allow you to define custom behavior for your classes when interacting with operators (operator overloading) or other language constructs.\n",
    "* A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names.\n",
    "* The naming convention for special methods is `__<name>__`, where the double underscores precede and succeed the method name.\n",
    "* Setting a special method to `None` indicates that the corresponding operation is not available.\n",
    "  * For example, if a class sets `__iter__()` to `None`, the class is not iterable, so calling `iter()` on its instances will raise a `TypeError` (without falling back to `__getitem__()`)."

    "    * Returns a string for a printable representation of the object.\n",
    "    * Called by the `repr()` built-in function or when an object is displayed in a console or notebook.\n",
    "    * This should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value.\n",
    "  * `__str__(self)`\n",
    "    * Called by `str()` and the built-in functions `format()` and `print()` to compute the printable string representation of an object. The return value must be a string object.\n",
    "    * This method differs from `__repr__()` in that there is no expectation that `__str__()` return a valid Python expression: a more convenient or concise representation can be used.\n",
    "    * If `__str__` is not implemented, Python will look for `__repr__` instead.\n",
    "    * If neither is implemented, the default implementation defined by the built-in type `object` calls `object.__repr__()`."

    "  * A class that overrides `__eq__()` and does not define `__hash__()` will have its `__hash__()` implicitly set to `None`. When the `__hash__()` method of a class is `None`, instances of the class will raise an appropriate `TypeError` when a program attempts to retrieve their hash value, and will also be correctly identified as unhashable when checking `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Hashable)`.\n",
    "  * If a class that overrides `__eq__()` needs to retain the implementation of `__hash__()` from a parent class, the interpreter must be told this explicitly by setting `__hash__ = <ParentClass>.__hash__`.\n",
    "  * If a class that does not override `__eq__()` wishes to suppress hash support, it should include `__hash__ = None` in the class definition.

    "\n",
    "* When a class inherits from a base class, it inherits all the attributes, including callables.\n",
    "* Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.\n",
    "* Derived classes may override / redefine methods of their base classes.\n",
    "  * Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it.\n",
    "* An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name.\n",
    "  * There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call `BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)`. Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as `BaseClassName` in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "`super`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `class super`, `class super(type, object_or_type=None)`\n",
    "  * Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a *parent* or *sibling* class of `type`. This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class.\n",
    "  * The `object_or_type` determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the `type`.\n",
    "    * For example, if `__mro__` of `object_or_type` is `D -> B -> C -> A -> object` and the value of `type` is `B`, then `super()` searches `C -> A -> object`.\n",
    "    * The `__mro__` attribute of the `object_or_type` lists the method resolution search order used by both `getattr()` and `super()`. The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated.\n",
    "  * If the second argument is omitted, the `super` object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, `isinstance(obj, type)` must be true. If the second argument is a type, `issubclass(type2, type)` must be true (this is useful for classmethods).\n",
    "* There are two typical use cases for `super`.\n",
    "  * In a class hierarchy with *single inheritance*, `super` can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable.\n",
    "  * The second use case is to support cooperative *multiple inheritance* in a dynamic execution environment.\n",
    "    * This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance.\n",
    "    * This makes it possible to implement \"diamond diagrams\" where multiple base classes implement the same method.\n",
    "    * Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime).\n",
    "  * In addition to method lookups, `super()` also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class.\n",
    "* Note that `super()` is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as `super().__getitem__(name)`. It does so by implementing its own `__getattribute__()` method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, `super()` is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as `super()[name]`.\n",
    "* Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, `super()` is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods.\n",
    "* For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative classes using super(), see [guide to using `super()`](https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/)."

    "* By default, Python objects use a dynamic dictionary (`__dict__`) to store their attributes. However, this dictionary consumes memory, especially when you have many instances of the same class.\n",
    "* `__slots__` allow us to explicitly declare *data members* (like properties) and deny the creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__` in *instances* (unless explicitly declared in `__slots__` or available in a parent.)\n",
    "* The space saved over using `__dict__` can be significant. Attribute lookup speed can be significantly improved as well.\n",
    "  * `__slots__` helps reduce memory usage by preallocating memory for specific attributes.\n",
    "* `object.__slots__`\n",
    "  * This class variable can be assigned a string, iterable, or sequence of strings with variable names used by instances.\n",
    "  * `__slots__` reserves space for the declared variables and prevents the automatic creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__` for each *instance*.\n",
    "    * Try to get `__dict__` attribute on an instance without it will result in `AttributeError`.\n",
    "    * Similarly, calling `vars` on such an instance will cause `TypeError`.\n",
    "    * `dir` still works.\n",
    "* Notes on using `__slots__`\n",
    "  * When inheriting from a class without `__slots__`, the `__dict__` and `__weakref__` attribute of the instances will always be accessible.\n",
    "  * Without a `__dict__` variable, instances cannot be assigned new variables not listed in the `__slots__` definition. Attempts to assign to an unlisted variable name raises `AttributeError`. If dynamic assignment of new variables is desired, then add `'__dict__'` to the sequence of strings in the `__slots__` declaration (this will result in an empty dictionary for `__dict__`)\n",
    "  * Without a `__weakref__` variable for each instance, classes defining `__slots__` do not support weak references to its instances. If weak reference support is needed, then add `'__weakref__'` to the sequence of strings in the `__slots__` declaration.\n",
    "  * `__slots__` are implemented at the class level by creating *descriptors* for each variable name. As a result, class attributes cannot be used to set default values for instance variables defined by `__slots__`; otherwise, the class attribute would overwrite the descriptor assignment.\n",
    "  * The action of a `__slots__` declaration is not limited to the class where it is defined. `__slots__` declared in parents are available in child classes. However, child subclasses will get a `__dict__` and `__weakref__` unless they also define `__slots__` (which should only contain names of any additional slots).\n",
    "  * If a class defines a slot also defined in a base class, the instance variable defined by the base class slot is inaccessible (except by retrieving its descriptor directly from the base class). This renders the meaning of the program undefined. In the future, a check may be added to prevent this.\n",
    "  * `TypeError` will be raised if nonempty `__slots__` are defined for a class derived from a \"variable-length\" built-in type such as `int`, `bytes`, and `tuple`.\n",
    "  * Any non-string iterable may be assigned to `__slots__`.\n",
    "  * If a dictionary is used to assign `__slots__`, the dictionary keys will be used as the slot names. The values of the dictionary can be used to provide per-attribute docstrings that will be recognized by `inspect.getdoc()` and displayed in the output of `help()`.\n",
    "  * `__class__` assignment works only if both classes have the same `__slots__`.\n",
    "  * Multiple inheritance with multiple slotted parent classes can be used, but only one parent is allowed to have attributes created by slots (the other bases must have empty slot layouts), violations raise `TypeError`.\n",
    "  * If an iterator is used for `__slots__` then a descriptor is created for each of the iterator's values. However, the `__slots__` attribute will be an empty iterator."

    "  * [The Descriptor How To Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors)\n",
    "* In general, a descriptor is an object attribute that defines any of the methods in the descriptor protocol: `__get__()`, `__set__()`, and `__delete__()`.\n",
    "  * Optionally, descriptors can have a `__set_name__()` method (new in version 3.6). This is only used in cases where a descriptor needs to know either the class where it was created or the name of class variable it was assigned to. (This method, if present, is called even if the class is not a descriptor.)\n",
    "* When an object attribute is a descriptor, it has special binding behavior, i.e. its attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol.\n",
    "  * The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the attribute from an object's dictionary. For instance, `a.x` has a lookup chain starting with `a.__dict__['x']`, then `type(a).__dict__['x']`, and continuing through the base classes of `type(a)` excluding metaclasses.\n",
    "  * However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined and how they were called.\n",
    "* Descriptors only work when used as *class variables*. When put in instances, they have no effect.\n",
    "* The main motivation for descriptors is to provide a hook allowing objects stored in class variables to control what happens during attribute lookup.\n",
    "  * Traditionally, the calling class controls what happens during lookup. Descriptors invert that relationship and allow the data being looked-up to have a say in the matter.\n",
    "* Understanding descriptors is a key to a deep understanding of Python because they are the basis for many features including functions, methods, properties, class methods, static methods, and reference to super classes.\n",
    "  * Descriptors are used throughout the language. It is how functions turn into bound methods.\n",
    "  * Common tools like `classmethod()`, `staticmethod()`, `property()`, and `functools.cached_property()` are all implemented as descriptors.\n",
    "* Two categories of descriptors:\n",
    "  * Implement `__get__` only: non-data descriptors\n",
    "  * Implement `__set__` and / or `__delete__`: data descriptors"

    "### Strong and weak references\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong references\n",
    "\n",
    "* A strong reference is the most common type of reference in Python.\n",
    "* When an object has one or more strong references, it remains alive in memory.\n",
    "* Objects referenced by variables, data structures (like lists or dictionaries), and function arguments are considered strongly referenced.\n",
    "* The reference count of an object increases when a strong reference is created.\n",
    "* Garbage collection does not reclaim an object as long as there are strong references to it.\n",
    "* In Python's C API, a strong reference is a reference to an object which is owned by the code holding the reference.\n",
    "  * The strong reference is taken by calling `Py_INCREF()` when the reference is created and released with `Py_DECREF()` when the reference is deleted.\n",
    "  * The `Py_NewRef()` function can be used to create a strong reference to an object.\n",
    "  * Usually, the `Py_DECREF()` function must be called on the strong reference before exiting the scope of the strong reference, to avoid leaking one reference.\n",
    "  See also borrowed reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak references\n",
    "\n",
    "* A weak reference to an object is a reference that does not prevent an object from being garbage collected.\n",
    "* When the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else.\n",
    "* However, until the object is actually destroyed the weak reference may return the object even if there are no strong references to it.\n",
    "* Use cases for weak references\n",
    "  * A primary use for weak references is to implement *caches* or *mappings* holding large objects, where it's desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.\n",
    "  * Reducing the impact of circular references (when objects reference each other in a loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Borrowed references\n",
    "\n",
    "* A borrowed reference is a term used in the context of CPython's memory management.\n",
    "* In Python's C API, a borrowed reference is a reference to an object, where the code using the object does not own the reference.\n",
    "* A borrowed reference becomes a dangling pointer if the object is destroyed.\n",
    "  * For example, a garbage collection can remove the last strong reference to the object and so destroy it.\n",
    "* When a function passes ownership of a reference to its caller, the caller receives a new reference (i.e. a borrowed reference).\n",
    "* No ownership transfer occurs for borrowed references; they do not affect the reference count.\n",
    "* Borrowed references are common when passing objects between functions or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "`weakref` module\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `weakref` module allows the Python programmer to create weak references to objects.\n",
    "* The `WeakKeyDictionary` and `WeakValueDictionary` classes supplied by the `weakref` module use weak references to construct mappings that don't keep objects alive solely because they appear in the mapping objects.\n",
    "* `WeakKeyDictionary` and `WeakValueDictionary` use weak references in their implementation, setting up callback functions on the weak references that notify the weak dictionaries when a key or value has been reclaimed by garbage collection.\n",
    "* `WeakSet` implements the set interface, but keeps weak references to its elements, just like a `WeakKeyDictionary` does.\n",
    "* `finalize` provides a straight forward way to register a cleanup function to be called when an object is garbage collected. This is simpler to use than setting up a callback function on a raw weak reference, since the module automatically ensures that the finalizer remains alive until the object is collected.\n",
    "* Most programs should find that using one of these weak container types or `finalize` is all they need. It's usually unnecessary to create your own weak references directly. The low-level machinery is exposed by the `weakref` module for the benefit of advanced uses.\n",
    "* Not all objects can be weakly referenced.\n",
    "  * Objects which support weak references include class instances, functions written in Python (but not in C), instance methods, sets, frozensets, some file objects, generators, type objects, sockets, arrays, deques, regular expression pattern objects, and code objects.\n",
    "  * Several built-in types such as `list` and `dict` do not directly support weak references but can add support through subclassing.\n",
    "  * Other built-in types such as `tuple` and `int` do not support weak references even when subclassed.\n",
    "  * When `__slots__` are defined for a given type, weak reference support is disabled unless a `'__weakref__'` string is also present in the sequence of strings in the `__slots__` declaration."

    "What are exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions.\n",
    "* An exception is raised at the point where the error is detected; it may be handled by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly or indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred.\n",
    "  * The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time error (such as division by zero).\n",
    "  * A Python program can also explicitly raise an exception with the `raise` statement.\n",
    "  * If current call does not handle the exception, it is propagated to the caller.\n",
    "    * call stack is maintained\n",
    "      * document origin of exception\n",
    "      * every call in the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exceptions are not necessarily fatal, i.e. do not necessarily result in program termination.\n",
    "  * We can handle exceptions as they occur:\n",
    "    * do something and let the program running normally\n",
    "    * do something and let the original exception propagate\n",
    "    * do something and raise a different exception\n",
    "  * When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates execution of the program, or returns to its interactive main loop. In either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the exception is `SystemExit`.\n",
    "* Exception handlers are specified with the `try...except...else...finally` statement. The `finally` clause of such a statement can be used to specify cleanup code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an exception occurred or not in the preceding code.\n",
    "  * Exceptions are identified by *class* instances. The `except` clause is selected depending on the class of the instance: it must reference the class of the instance or a non-virtual base class thereof.\n",
    "  * The `except` clause that mentions a particular class also handles any exception classes derived from that class (but not exception classes from which it is derived).\n",
    "  * Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two main categories of exceptions\n",
    "  * Compilation exceptions (e.g. `SyntaxError`, `IndentationError`, `TabError`)\n",
    "  * Execution exceptions (e.g. `ZeroDivisionError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, `FileNotFoundError`)\n",
    "* In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from `BaseException`.\n",
    "  * [Exception hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy)\n",
    "  * The built-in exception classes can be subclassed to define new exceptions; programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses, and not from `BaseException`.\n",
    "  * More information on defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under [User-defined Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-userexceptions).\n",

    "### Handling exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions.\n",
    "* The `try` statement works as follows.\n",
    "  * First, the `try` clause (the statement(s) between the `try` and `except` keywords) is executed.\n",
    "  * If no exception occurs, the `except` clause is skipped and execution of the `try` statement is finished.\n",
    "  * If an exception occurs during execution of the `try` clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then, if its type matches the exception named after the `except` keyword, the `except` clause is executed, and then execution continues after the `try...except` block.\n",
    "  * If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the `except` clause, it is passed on to outer `try` statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with an error message.\n",
    "* A `try` statement must have at least one `except` or `finally` clause.\n",
    "* A `try` statement may have zero or more `except` clauses, to specify handlers for different exceptions.\n",
    "  * At most one handler will be executed.\n",
    "  * Arrange the `except` clauses from most specific to least specific, i.e. you should catch more specialized exceptions before more general ones.\n",
    "  * If you want to handle all exceptions, it's better to use `except Exception:` instead of a plain `except:`. The latter catches even `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which may not be desired.\n",
    "* An expression-less `except` clause, if present, must be last.\n",
    "  * It matches any exception.\n",
    "  * It is good in certain circumstances.\n",
    "    * do some cleanup work\n",
    "    * logging\n",
    "    * re-raise exception\n",
    "  * Use `sys.exc_info()` to get info about current exception.\n",
    "    * return a tuple `(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)`\n",
    "* An `except` clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized *tuple*.\n",
    "* A class in an `except` clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof.\n",
    "* When an exception occurs, it may have associated values, also known as the exception's arguments. The presence and types of the arguments depend on the exception type.\n",
    "  * Standard exceptions have at least two properties:\n",
    "    * `args`\n",
    "      * arguments used to create exception objects\n",
    "      * often error messages\n",
    "    * `__traceback__`\n",
    "      * the traceback object\n",
    "      * use `traceback` module for easier visualization: `print_tb`, `print_exception`\n",
    "      * it is the same object as last item returned by `sys.exc_info()`\n",
    "* The `except` clause may specify a variable after the exception name with the `as` keyword.\n",
    "  * The variable is bound to the exception instance.\n",
    "  * The variable is cleared at the end of the `except` clause.\n",
    "    * This means the exception must be assigned to a different name to be able to refer to it after the `except` clause.\n",
    "* The `except*` clause(s) are used for handling `ExceptionGroups`. The exception type for matching is interpreted as in the case of `except`, but in the case of exception groups we can have partial matches when the type matches some of the exceptions in the group.\n",
    "* `BaseException` is the common base class of all exceptions.\n",
    "  * One of its subclasses, `Exception`, is the base class of all the *non-fatal* exceptions.\n",
    "  * Exceptions which are not subclasses of `Exception` are not typically handled, because they are used to indicate that the program should terminate.\n",
    "    * They include `SystemExit` which is raised by `sys.exit()`,\n",
    "    * `KeyboardInterrupt` which is raised when a user wishes to interrupt the program, and\n",
    "    * `GeneratorExit` which is raised when a generator or coroutine is closed and it is technically not an error.\n",
    "* The most common pattern for handling `Exception` is to print or log the exception and then re-raise it (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well).\n",
    "  * A bare `raise` statement re-raises the last caught exception. Whether this occurs within a `try...except` block or not, if there has been a previously caught exception, invoking `raise` will re-raise that same exception.\n",
    "  * If you encounter a situation where you want to propagate the same exception further up the call stack, you can use `raise` without any arguments.\n",
    "* The `try...except` statement has an optional `else` clause, which, when present, must follow all `except` clauses hence it requires at least on `except` clause present.\n",
    "  * The `else` clause is executed if the control flow leaves the `try` suite, no exception was raised, and no `return`, `continue`, or `break` statement was executed.\n",
    "  * It is useful for code that must be executed if the `try` clause does not raise an exception.\n",
    "  * The use of the `else` clause is better than adding additional code to the `try` clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn't raised by the code being protected by the `try...except` statement.\n",
    "* The try statement has another optional `finally` clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances.\n",
    "  * If a `finally` clause is present, it will execute as the last task before the `try` statement completes.\n",
    "  * The `finally` clause runs whether or not the `try` statement produces an exception.\n",
    "  * The `finally` statement works as follows.\n",
    "    * The `try` clause is executed, including any `except` and `else` clauses.\n",
    "    * If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved.\n",
    "    * The `finally` clause is executed. If there is a saved exception it is *re-raised* at the end of the `finally` clause.\n",
    "    * If the `finally` clause raises another exception, the saved exception is set as the context of the new exception.\n",
    "    * If the `finally` clause executes a `return`, `break` or `continue` statement, the saved exception is discarded.\n",
    "  * The following points discuss more complex cases when an exception occurs:\n",
    "    * If an exception occurs during execution of the `try` clause, the exception may be handled by an `except` clause. If the exception is not handled by an `except` clause, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.\n",
    "    * An exception could occur during execution of an `except` or `else` clause. Again, the exception is re-raised after the `finally` clause has been executed.\n",
    "    * If the `finally` clause executes a `break`, `continue` or `return` statement, exceptions are not re-raised.\n",
    "    * If the `try` statement reaches a `break`, `continue` or `return` statement, the `finally` clause will execute just prior to the `break`, `continue` or `return` statement's execution.\n",
    "    * If a `finally` clause includes a `return` statement, the returned value will be the one from the `finally` clause's return statement, not the value from the `try` clause's return statement.\n",
    "  * In real world applications, the `finally` clause is useful for releasing external resources (such as files or network connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.\n",
    "  * Prior to Python 3.8, a `continue` statement was illegal in the `finally` clause due to a problem with the implementation.\n",
    "* Exception handling can be nested inside the `try` clause, `except`, `else`, and even `finally`.\n",

    "* It is easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.\n",
    "  * Sometimes referred to as the EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission) principle in Python.\n",
    "  * The saying suggests that you should take action without seeking permission first. If your actions end up upsetting certain people, it's easier to apologize and seek forgiveness afterward rather than waiting for approval initially. However, while the idea seems valid, the philosophy behind it is flawed.\n",
    "  * The saying implies that it's more convenient to act first and apologize later if necessary. Instead of seeking permission upfront, you proceed with your plans and deal with any consequences afterward.\n",
    "  * The phrase is attributed to Grace Murray Hopper, a renowned computer scientist. Hopper used this philosophy in her work on computer programs, emphasizing action over hesitation. She believed in making progress by doing what she knew would work, even if it meant asking for forgiveness later.\n",
    "  * Wisdom or Selfishness:\n",
    "    * While the saying has some merit, it's not a wise way to live:\n",
    "      * Repeatedly acting without permission erodes trust.\n",
    "      * People may perceive you as selfish or irresponsible.\n",
    "      * Accountability often falls on those who consistently bypass permission.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The `raise` statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur.\n",
    "  * If no expressions are present, `raise` re-raises the exception that is currently being handled, which is also known as the *active exception*. If there isn't currently an active exception, a `RuntimeError` exception is raised indicating that this is an error.\n",
    "  * If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don't intend to handle it, the expression-less `raise` statement allows you to re-raise the exception.\n",
    "  * Otherwise, `raise` evaluates the first expression as the exception object.\n",
    "    * It must be either a subclass or an instance of BaseException. If it is a class, the exception instance will be obtained when needed by instantiating the class with no arguments.\n",
    "* The type of the exception is the exception instance's class, the value is the instance itself.\n",
    "* A traceback object is normally created automatically when an exception is raised and attached to it as the `__traceback__` attribute.\n",
    "  * You can create an exception and set your own traceback in one step using the `with_traceback()` exception method (which returns the same exception instance, with its traceback set to its argument), like so: `raise Exception(\"foo occurred\").with_traceback(tracebackobj)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "* If an unhandled exception occurs inside an `except` section, it will have the exception being handled attached to it and included in the error message.\n",
    "* To indicate that an exception is a direct consequence of another, the `raise` statement allows an optional `from` clause.\n",
    "  * if given, the second expression must be another exception class or instance.\n",
    "    * If the second expression is an exception instance, it will be attached to the raised exception as the `__cause__` attribute (which is *writable*).\n",
    "    * If the expression is an exception class, the class will be instantiated and the resulting exception instance will be attached to the raised exception as the `__cause__` attribute.\n",
    "* A similar mechanism works implicitly if a new exception is raised when an exception is already being handled. An exception may be handled when an `except` or `finally` clause, or a `with` statement, is used. The previous exception is then attached as the new exception's `__context__` attribute.\n",
    "* Exception chaining can be explicitly suppressed by specifying `None` in the `from` clause, i.e. automatic exception chaining can be disabled using the `from None` idiom."

    "\n",
    "* There are situations where it is necessary to report several exceptions that have occurred.\n",
    "  * This is often the case in concurrency frameworks, when several tasks may have failed in parallel, but there are also other use cases where it is desirable to continue execution and collect multiple errors rather than raise the first exception.\n",
    "* The builtin `ExceptionGroup` wraps a list of exception instances so that they can be raised together. It is an exception itself, so it can be caught like any other exception.\n",
    "* By using `except*` instead of `except`, we can selectively handle only the exceptions in the group that match a certain type, letting all other exceptions propagate to other clauses and eventually to be re-raised.\n",
    "* Note that the exceptions nested in an exception group must be *instances*, not types. This is because in practice the exceptions would typically be ones that have already been raised and caught by the program."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data.\n",
    "* It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.\n",
    "* The basic idea is we can use code to modify code.\n",
    "* It helps keep code DRY (don't repeat yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of metaprogramming\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parsers\n",
    "  * Programs that analyze and interpret other programs or data formats.\n",
    "* Interpreters\n",
    "  * Metaprogramming enables building interpreters for custom languages.\n",
    "* Compilers\n",
    "  * Writing compilers involves metaprogramming to translate high-level code into machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaprogramming in Python\n",
    "* Decorators\n",
    "  * Use code to modify the behavior of another piece of code\n",
    "  * Decorators themselves can be functions or classes, i.e. function-based decorators and class-based decorators.\n",
    "  * Function decorators vs class decorators\n",
    "    * [Function decorators](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/): decorators for functions and methods, applying transformation to functions or methods\n",
    "      * Common use cases\n",
    "        * Logging: add logging statements before and after function execution\n",
    "        * Timing: measure the execution time of a function\n",
    "        * Authorization: check user permissions before allowing access to a function\n",
    "        * Caching: cache function results for performance optimization\n",
    "    * [Class decorators](https://peps.python.org/pep-3129/): decorators for classes, they are decorators working similarly to function decorators but decorate classes instead of functions or methods\n",
    "  * Decorator functions vs decorator classes\n",
    "    * They are different approaches to implement decorators, i.e. function-based or class-based decorators respectively.\n",
    "    * Function-based decorators: functions that accept another function as an argument and return a new function that incorporates additional functionality\n",
    "      * Advantages\n",
    "        * Simplicity: easier to create and use\n",
    "        * Automatic handling: works seamlessly with methods (functions within classes)\n",
    "        * Lightweight: minimal overhead\n",
    "        * Easy to return the original function after modification\n",
    "    * Class-based decorators: classes that implements the decorator behavior with an `__init__` method to receive the original class (or function) and an `__call__` method to modify its behavior\n",
    "      * Advantages\n",
    "        * State management: easier to maintain state (e.g. keeping track of counts, caching)\n",
    "        * Extensibility: can add methods and properties to the decorated callable object\n",
    "        * Inheritance: allows creating similar but different decorators\n",
    "* Descriptors\n",
    "  * Use code to essentially modify the behavior of the dot operator\n",
    "* Metaclasses\n",
    "  * Knowing when to use a metaclass is not easy. Unless you come across a problem where the use of a metaclass is obvious, don't use it.\n",
    "  * Just because you have a new hammer does not mean everything is a nail.\n",
    "  * Beware of the \"solution in search of a problem\" syndrome.\n",
    "    * solution in search of a problem (*plural* solutions in search of problems):\n",
    "      * A proposal that does not solve any problem or provide any value; or one that is intended to fill a need which does not really exist.\n",

The remaining arguments are those passed to the object constructor expression (the call to the class). The return value of `__new__()` should be the new object instance (usually an instance of `cls`).\n",
    "  * Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the superclass's `__new__()` method using `super().__new__(cls[, ...])` with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly created instance as necessary before returning it.\n",
    "  * If `__new__()` is invoked during *object construction* (i.e. calling the class) and it returns an instance of `cls`, then the new instance's `__init__()` method will be invoked like `__init__(self[, ...])`, where `self` is the new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were passed to the object constructor.\n",
    "  * If `__new__()` does not return an instance of `cls`, then the new instance's `__init__()` method will not be invoked.\n",
    "  * `__new__()` is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable types (like `int`, `str`, or `tuple`) to customize instance creation. It is also commonly overridden in custom *metaclasses* in order to customize class creation."

    "* In declarative creation of classes, Python doing the following steps:\n",
    "  * extracts name\n",
    "  * extracts bases\n",
    "  * creates a class dictionary, by calling `__prepare__`\n",
    "  * executes the class body within that class dictionary\n",
    "  * calls the metaclass to create the class\n",
    "  * assign the created class to the symbol (name) in the scope\n",
    "* In programmatic creation of classes, we reproduce the above process manually:\n",
    "  * define name, bases\n",
    "  * create an initial class dictionary\n",
    "  * calculate and add `__qualname__`, `__doc__` to the class dictionary\n",
    "  * execute the code in the context of the class dictionary\n",
    "  * call metaclass to create the class\n",
    "* When we make instances of a custom class callable, we implement `__call__` method in it.\n",
    "  * `__call__(self[, args...])`\n",
    "    * Called when the instance is \"called\" as a function; if this method is defined, `x(arg1, arg2, ...)` roughly translates to `type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)`.\n",
    "* But the class itself is callable, so the class created the custom class, i.e. its metaclass (usually `type`), must implement `__call__`.\n",
    "  * `type` is a class that implements a `__call__` method.\n",
    "  * The `__call__` method is called when its instance, i.e. a class, is called as a method bound to the class instance.\n",
    "    * `__call__` calls `__new__` of the class to create a new instance of the class instance\n",
    "    * then calls `__init__` of the class instance bound to the new instance created by `__new__`\n",
    "    * returns the new initialized instance of the class instance\n",
    "* `type`'s metaclass is itself.\n",
    "  * the `__call__` of `type` is also called when `type` is called.\n",
    "    * calls `type.__new__` to create a new class instance\n",

    "  * plain class attribute\n",
    "  * in a parent class\n",
    "* `__getattribute__(self, name)`\n",
    "  * Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class, i.e. when an attribute is accessed on an instance of a class it is invoked.\n",
    "  * If the class also defines `__getattr__()`, the latter will not be called unless `__getattribute__()` either calls it explicitly or raises an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "  * This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an `AttributeError` exception.\n",
    "  * In order to avoid infinite recursion in this method, its implementation should always call the base class method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for example, `object.__getattribute__(self, name)`.\n",
    "  * This method may still be bypassed when looking up special methods as the result of implicit invocation via language syntax or built-in functions.\n",
    "  * For certain sensitive attribute accesses, raises an auditing event `object.__getattr__` with arguments obj and name.\n",
    "  * It is very easy to get into infinite recursion when overriding `__getattribute__`.\n",
    "    * use `super().__getattribute__` to bypass your own overrides\n",
    "* `__getattr__(self, name)`\n",
    "  * Called when the default attribute access fails with an `AttributeError` (either `__getattribute__()` raises an `AttributeError` because `name` is not an instance attribute or an attribute in the class tree for `self`; or `__get__()` of a `name` property raises `AttributeError`).\n",
    "  * This method should either return the (computed) attribute value or raise an `AttributeError` exception.\n",
    "  * `object` does not have attribute `__getattr__` by default.\n",
    "  * If the attribute is found through the normal mechanism, `__getattr__()` is not called.\n",
    "    * This is an intentional asymmetry between `__getattr__()` and `__setattr__()`.\n",
    "    * This is done both for efficiency reasons and because otherwise `__getattr__()` would have no way to access other attributes of the instance.\n",
    "  * At least for instance variables, you can fake total control by not inserting any values in the instance attribute dictionary (but instead inserting them in another object).\n",
